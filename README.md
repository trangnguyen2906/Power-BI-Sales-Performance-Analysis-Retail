## 🧠 Design Thinking Process 

This project leveraged **Design Thinking process** to deeply explore stakeholder needs and shape a focused dashboard that supports strategic decision-making.

### 2️⃣ **Define point of view:** 
I defined the problem as the lack of a centralized, visual dashboard to track profit, return, and growth across regions and products.

### 4️⃣ **Prototype and review:**

I built the dashboard in Power BI and reviewed it to ensure it answers key stakeholder questions effectively. Then, I reviewed it through the lens of the stakeholder questions and refined the visuals to ensure they deliver clear insights for strategic action.

## ⚒️ Main Process

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing (Power Query + DAX)
- Connected to Superstore source files (Orders, People, Returns) in Power BI.
- Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query Editor**:
 + Used first row as headers, changed data types, and **removed/replaced invalid values.**
 + **Merged tables** (e.g., Orders + Returns) to track return status per transaction.
 + **Added custom columns** to flag returned orders and calculate profit margins.
 + **Reordered and renamed columns** for consistency and ease of use.
- Built a **relational data model** by creating relationships among the tables.
- Created essential DAX measures and calculated columns for key metrics: `Total Profit`, `% Return`, `Sales Growth`, `AOV`,...


### 2️⃣ Power BI Visualization
Developed a multi-page interactive dashboard in Power BI with filters and KPIs, focusing on strategic decision-making.

Each page answers specific stakeholder questions:

- **Page 1 –** **Business Overview:** Financial health, sales trends, profit by different dimensions.

- **Page 2 –** **Product & Market Insights:** Top/bottom products, profitable countries, product-level profit margin.

- **Page 3 –** **Customer Patterns & Risks:** Return analysis, shipping behavior, customer segmentation.
