2️⃣ **Define point of view:** I defined the problem as the lack of a centralized, visual dashboard to track profit, return, and growth across regions and products.

3️⃣ **Ideate:** I designed a 4-page dashboard structure that covers financial overview, product-market insights, customer behavior.

4️⃣ **Prototype and review:**

I built the dashboard in Power BI and reviewed it to ensure it answers key stakeholder questions effectively. Then, I reviewed it through the lens of the stakeholder questions and refined the visuals to ensure they deliver clear insights for strategic action.
