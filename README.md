## ⚒️ Main Process

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing (Power Query + DAX)
- Connected to Superstore source files (Orders, People, Returns) in Power BI.
- Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query Editor**:
 + Used first row as headers, changed data types, and **removed/replaced invalid values.**
 + **Merged tables** (e.g., Orders + Returns) to track return status per transaction.
 + **Added custom columns** to flag returned orders and calculate profit margins.
 + **Reordered and renamed columns** for consistency and ease of use.
- Built a **relational data model** by creating relationships among the tables.
- Created essential DAX measures and calculated columns for key metrics: `Total Profit`, `% Return`, `Sales Growth`, `AOV`,...


### 2️⃣ Power BI Visualization
Developed a multi-page interactive dashboard in Power BI with filters and KPIs, focusing on strategic decision-making.

Each page answers specific stakeholder questions:

- **Page 1 –** **Business Overview:** Financial health, sales trends, profit by different dimensions.

- **Page 2 –** **Product & Market Insights:** Top/bottom products, profitable countries, product-level profit margin.

- **Page 3 –** **Customer Patterns & Risks:** Return analysis, shipping behavior, customer segmentation.

## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations  
 

### 1️⃣ Page 1: Business Performance Overview - Preview  

![Dashboard Walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HyZkhunpnyqoVN_bR2zvdNqDOZjFgouG)

### 📌 Analysis 1:  

To understand overall business health, I started with an executive-level view of key metrics including:  
💰 **Total Profit:** $1.5M 📦 **Total Sales:** $12.64M 📄 **Total Orders:** 25.04K 📈 **% Profit:** 11.61% 📦 **% Return Rate:** 5.95%

From the visualizations, I observed the following:

### 🔍 1. Sales Performance Is Strong, but Margins Are Modest  
- **💡 Observation:**
Total **sales** reached **$12.64M**, but only **$1.5M in profit** was generated, resulting in a **profit margin of 11.61%**. This shows that high sales volume does not directly translate into high profitability, possibly due to cost structure or product mix.

- **✅ Recommendation:**
Prioritize margin optimization by identifying high-volume but low-profit products. Review pricing strategies, reduce discount dependency, and streamline costs to protect profitability without sacrificing sales volume.

### 🔍 2. Consistent Seasonal Trends
- **💡 Observation:**
Each year, **Q1 consistently shows the lowest sales and profit**, but performance **steadily improves through Q2–Q4**, with the highest **peak in Q4 2014 ($1.48M)**. Despite these seasonal dips, the overall trend in both sales and profit is **upward**, indicating healthy business momentum.

- **✅ Recommendation:**
Mitigate Q1 drops by launching retention-focused campaigns early in the year, offering loyalty incentives, and planning proactive inventory and pricing strategies ahead of Q3, Q4 to capture peak demand efficiently.

### 🔍 3. Sub-Category Profitability Varies Widely
- **💡 Observation:**
 + **Technology** is the top-performing category: 📠 **Copiers** and 📱 **Phones** show strong sales and high profits, while **Accessories** also perform well.
 + **Office Supplies** has the **highest margin sub-category** — 📎 **Paper (24.24%)**, but most others (e.g., Binders, Envelopes) contribute low profit due to small sales.
 + **Furniture** underperforms overall: 🪑 Tables have a **negative margin (-8.46%)**, and while 📚 **Bookcases** and **Chairs** generate decent sales, their margins **(11–12%) are below other categories.**

- **✅ Recommendation:**
  + Double down on Technology and Paper through bundling or cross-sell. 
  + Investigate the viability of low-performing products like Tables and Envelopes, whether due to pricing, high returns, or low demand—and consider repositioning, redesigning, or phasing them out.

### 🔍 4. Consumer Leads in Sales, but Home Office Delivers Highest Margin
- **💡 Observation:**
  + **Consumer segment** generates the **highest revenue** at $6.5M, but yields the lowest profit margin (11.51%).
  
  + Home Office is the smallest segment by sales ($2.3M) but delivers the **highest profit margin (11.99%)**.

- **✅ Recommendation:**
Reinforce engagement with Home Office customers through premium or recurring offerings. Explore ways to increase volume in this segment while protecting margins. Simultaneously, analyze costs and pricing in the Consumer segment to improve margin without sacrificing scale.

### 🔍 5. APAC Leads in Sales, Followed by Europe, US, and LATAM
- **💡 Observation:**
**APAC** drives the highest sales volume, followed by **Europe**. The **US and LATAM** are close behind, while **Africa, EMEA (non-EU), and Canada** remain **low** in both presence and volume. As the chart reflects sales only, profitability must be evaluated using other visuals.
  
- **✅ Recommendation:**
Sustain growth in APAC, Europe, and the US through focused operations and optimization. For emerging markets such as LATAM and Africa, refer to margin data from Page 2 to identify where lean expansion or pilot initiatives may yield strategic growth.

![Technology Region Profit Margin](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1KEXVnHP2fSkRdtrnt3_eozf3O31Pv2Ab)


### 📌 Analysis 2:   
  
### 🔍 **1. Technology – High Revenue Driver with Uneven Product & Market Outcomes**
- Technology is the **top-performing category**, generating **$4.74M in revenue** and contributing **$663.8K in profit**, with a solid **margin of 13.99%**. However, this strong overall performance masks wide **variation** between **sub-categories and regions**.

- The top sub-categories include:

+ **📠 Copiers:** $258.6K profit, 17.13% margin
+ **🧩 Accessories:** $129.2K profit, 17.3% margin
+ **📱 Phones:** $216.7K profit, 12.7% margin

These high-margin products drive most of the category’s success and are particularly strong in regions like **Central EU, North Asia, and the US.**

- ⚠️ However, **Machines** remain a weak spot, with the **lowest margin (7.56%)**. Many low-performing SKUs (e.g., Zebra, Lexmark, Okidata) appear in the top loss-making list, especially in countries such as **Turkey, Nigeria, and the Netherlands**.
- ⚠️ Meanwhile, Canada emerges as a margin outlier,despite its low sales volume, it delivers the **highest profit margin** of all regions, suggesting strong operational efficiency and potential for targeted expansion.
- ❗ Losses are concentrated in Africa, EMEA, and parts of LATAM, often tied to low-efficiency Machines and Copiers.

### **✅ Recommendation:**

- **Expand Copiers, Accessories, and Phones** in high-performing regions such as **Central EU, North Asia, and the US**, where both volume and margin potential are proven.

- **Conduct a SKU-level audit** of the **Machines sub-category**, especially in underperforming countries like Turkey, Nigeria, and the Netherlands. Prioritize phasing out or rebranding low-efficiency products.

- **Leverage Canada** as a high-margin testbed for premium tech offerings. Despite its small size, its operational efficiency makes it ideal for pilot campaigns or bundling strategies.

- In low-performing markets like **Africa, EMEA, and parts of LATAM**, **avoid expanding Machines**, and instead introduce high-margin, low-risk products like **Accessories** through lean, targeted rollouts.
  
### 🔍 **2. Office Supplies – Consistent Performer with Broad Base**
- Office Supplies is a **strong, consistent contributor with $3.79M in sales** and **$518.5K in total profit**, maintaining a healthy **13.69% profit margin**. Its strength lies in a **balanced portfolio of sub-categories**, driven by **broad customer demand and high product variety.**
The **top-performing sub-categories** by margin and scale include:

- 📄 **Paper**: $59.2K profit | 24.24% margin  
- ✉️ **Envelopes**: $29.6K profit | 17.32% margin  
- 🖌️ **Art**: $57.9K profit | 15.58% margin  
- 📘 **Binders**: $72.4K profit | 15.68% margin  
- ⚡ **Appliances**: $141.7K profit | 14.01% margin  

These sub-categories show **strong margin-to-volume efficiency**, and products like paper and binders see **high order counts** (e.g., Binders: 5,392 orders).

Meanwhile, categories like:

- 🏷️ **Labels** (20.45% margin) show high profitability **despite lower volume** (2,460 orders), indicating untapped premium product potential.
- 📦 **Storage** drives the second-highest profit ($108.4K) with respectable margins (9.62%), highlighting operational reliability.

However, attention is needed for:

- 🔧 **Fasteners** and **Supplies**: While positive, they lag behind in margin (13.85% and 9.29%) and exhibit higher return rates (7.31% and 5.86%).


### 🌍 Regional Performance

- 🏆 **Central EU** leads with the highest profit among all regions for Office Supplies, making it a strategic priority for expansion.
- **United States** contributes the largest absolute profit ($100K+), indicating scale advantages.
- ⚠️ **Turkey, Nigeria, and Netherlands** are consistently present in the **bottom loss-making countries**, reflecting weak SKU performance and high return rates.
- 📈 **Canada**, despite low volume, again shows favorable profit margins and should be considered for lean growth pilots.

### ✅ Recommendations

- **Prioritize Paper, Envelopes, Art, and Appliances** for strategic investment and promotion, especially in mature markets like the **US** and **Central EU**.
- **Explore pricing optimization and bundling** for niche segments like **Labels**, which exhibit strong margins despite fewer orders.
- **Investigate high-return SKUs** in **Fasteners** and **Supplies** to minimize leakage, particularly in underperforming markets like **Turkey** and **Nigeria**.
- **Pilot lightweight bundles** in **Canada** and under-tapped LATAM areas to test margin potential using top-performing SKUs.

### 🔍 **3. Furniture – High Revenue, Low Margin with Clear Risk Zones**

Furniture delivers a sizable **$4.11M in sales** but only contributes **$285.2K in total profit**, resulting in a relatively low **6.94% profit margin**. Despite strong revenue, profitability is uneven across sub-categories and markets.

Top-performing sub-categories include:

- 💺 **Chairs**: $140.4K profit | **9.35% margin**  
- 🛋 **Furnishings**: $46.9K profit | **12.18% margin**  
- 📚 **Bookcases**: $161.9K profit | **11.04% margin**

These categories show consistent returns, with some SKUs (especially in Furnishings and Bookcases) achieving margins above **40%**, even at moderate order volumes — suggesting potential in specialized or premium lines.

⚠️ However, **Tables** emerge as a major weakness, posting **–$64K in losses** and a **negative margin of –8.46%**. Numerous SKUs fall below –50% profit margin, with some as extreme as –230% (e.g., Chromcraft, Lesro, Barricks), indicating cost inefficiencies, pricing issues, or low product-market fit.


### 🌍 Regional Performance

- 💰 **Central Asia** and **North Asia** lead in Furniture profit, making them strategic priorities for regional growth.  
- **China** and **India** are top profit-contributing countries, reinforcing Asia’s role as a high-return market.  
- **United States** delivers high order volumes but lower profit, hinting at possible SKU mix or cost structure challenges.  
- ❌ **Turkey**, **Nigeria**, and **Netherlands** consistently rank among the **bottom loss-making countries**, heavily impacted by underperforming Tables.  
- 📌 **Canada**, though small in volume, records the **highest margin region-wide**, making it an ideal candidate for lean-market pilots or premium bundling.

### ✅ Recommendations

- Prioritize **Chairs, Furnishings, and Bookcases** for strategic scaling, especially those with margins >25%, through bundling, B2B offerings, or premium positioning.  
- Audit and **restructure the Tables sub-category**, eliminating persistently negative SKUs and reassessing cost-to-revenue ratios.  
- Focus expansion efforts on **Central Asia and North Asia**, where both demand and margins align.  
- Launch **lightweight test pilots in Canada** to validate high-margin, low-cost Furniture deployment.  
- In **loss-heavy markets** like Turkey and Nigeria, avoid low-margin Tables and explore alternatives like Chairs or modular accessories with better profitability.
